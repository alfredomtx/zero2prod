# zero2prod
This repository is my journey following the book "Zero2Prod" written by Luca Palmieri, where we build a backend web application in Rust from zero, using industry standards and current technologies and metodologies, guided by the author which is an extremely experienced engineer.

The application we are building is an Email Newsletter backend API.


## Book description
[Zero To Production In Rust](https://zero2prod.com) is an opinionated introduction to backend development using Rust.

The book takes you on a journey to discover the world of backend development in Rust.

You will learn by doing: we will start from scratch and build together, step by step, a fully functional email newsletter backend API.

You'll learn how to:
- Navigate and leverage Rust's crates ecosystem
- Structure your application to make it modular and extensible
- Write tests, from single units to full-blown integration tests
- Model your domain and leverage the type system to enforce invariants
- Collect logs, traces and metrics to observe the state of your application
- Set up a robust continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for your Rust pr
